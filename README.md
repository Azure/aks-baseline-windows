This repository demonstrates recommended ways to deploy and manage Windows workloads on AKS. To learn more about how enterprises can look at setting up their team and manage in terms of a separation of concerns and automation / CI/CD,please take a look at our [Automation baseline repo](https://github.com/Azure/aks-baseline-automation/).

This repository is a part of the [AKS Landing zone accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/AKS-Landing-Zone-Accelerator), an open-source collection of ARM, Bicep and Terraform templates that represent the strategic design path and target technical state for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployment. Head over there to started.

Our baseline architecture, which is our Secure Baseline Private Cluster scenario is available in the Scenarios folder and uses the architecture below.
